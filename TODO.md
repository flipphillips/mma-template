# To Do

![icon](icon.png)

## Priority

- change 'experiment' to 'project' everywhere (see the dynamic organics project)
- add project directory and move NB there
- either make the subdirectories in the init code, or automake them (perhaps a new piece of code that does that)
- `gitignore` and some `vscode` stuff.
- template `gitattributes`

## Still to do

- Auto-generate with substitutions.
- Clean up the `global` and `paths` directories.
- Auto setup LFS.
- Maybe too much template code so far?
