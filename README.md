# MMa

![icon](icon.png)

A template for Mathematica Projects.

## Theory

A generic setup for MMa experiments.

This stuff should probably use LFS for related things. The problem is that the template mechanism in GitHub doesn't support it very well yet. So you have to maybe do it after you instantiate the template.

## How to set up

*Note that, this should be automated at some point.*

1. Run `setup_version` to copy over proper scripts into `.git/hooks`
2. Change `version.json` to have proper data.
3. Turn on `git lfs`.
